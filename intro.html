			This web app is a very simple demo / proof-of-concept for a speech recognition based language learning website. Functionality is very simple (and sometimes buggy), as it was my first ever foray into Javascript.
		</p>

		<p>
			A fully fledged version would allow multiple languages, scenarios, track words mispronounced, allow the user to hide words to increase difficulty level, etc...
		</p>

			When you start the demo and click the red circle to speak, you will need to allow permission to use you microphone, in the top right corner of your screen.

			It looks like you are not using Google Chrome. This demo uses Google Chrome Speech Recognition Toolkit, and will not function unless run in Google Chrome. Please reopen this page in a Chrome browser. Apologies!
